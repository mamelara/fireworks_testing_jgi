#Project FireWorks Workflow Management System
##Purpose: 
The purpose of this repo is to document steps taken to utilize
the workflow manager FireWorks and document any difficulties and
advantages in implementing it to JGI's pipelines

-First issue, ran across tqdm import error. FireWorks depends on this but it
is not downloaded as a dependency.
